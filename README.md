Greetings to all! this will be the first of 5 projects I will be working on. I will be attemping a to do list project using python. There are a 
few things that I be the main focus of me trying to implement into file.

2) Mark tasks as completed
3) delete tasks
4) view current tasks

added inputs for asking for errands as well as for "anything else" createad an
if statement for initial chore and nested inside a while loop stating that while
anything else != '' continue to ask.. all that works fine but my current else "why are you here go enjoy your day" prints regardless if the list that I created called toDo is empty or not when, I want it to only print if toDo is empty.

turns out coding temple is having me do a to do list project so i will scrap my original and start over from a clean slate.. it feels better that way for me but i will still attempt to implement my 4 requirements:
    1. add tasks
    2. mark tasks as completed
    3. delete tasks
    4. view current tasks

1) User Interface
    1. Create a command line interface for the application
    2. display welcome message and menu with following options:
        Welcome to the To-Do List App!
        Menu:
        1. Add a task
        2. View tasks
        3. Mark a task as complete
        4. Delete a task
        5. Quit

2) To-Do List Features:
    1) Implement the follwing features for the List:
        1. adding a task with a title (by default 'incomplete')
        2. Viewing the list of tasks with their titles and statuses 
           (e.g., "Incomplete" or "Complete").
        3. Marking a task as complete.
        4. Deleting a task.
        5. Quitting the application.

3) User Interaction
    Allow users to interact with the application by selecting menu options using input().
    Implement input validation to handle unexpected user input gracefully.

4) Error Handling:
    1. Implement error handling using try, except, else, and finally blocks to handle potential issues.


5) Code Organization:
    1. Organize your code into functions to promote modularity and readability.
    2. Use meaningful function names with appropriate comments and docstrings for clarity.


6) Testing and Debugging:
    1. Thoroughly test your application to identify and fix any bugs.
    2. Consider edge cases, such as empty task lists or incorrect user input.


7. Documentation:
    1. Include a README file that explains how to run the application and provides a brief overview of its features.


8. Optional Features (Bonus):
    1. If you feel adventurous, you can add extra features like task priorities, due dates, or color-coding tasks based on their status.


9. GitHub Repository:
    1. Create a GitHub repository for your project.
    2. Commit your code to the repository regularly.
    3. Include a link to your GitHub repository in your project documentation.
